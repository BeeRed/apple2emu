# Apple2Emu - An Apple ][ Emulator

Apple2Emu is an Apple ][ emulator.  Having started programming on the Apple ][ in the early 80's, I have always wanted to write an emulator for that system.  One goal for this emulator is to be cross platform (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux).  Given modern hardware, the need to write obfustaced code for the sake of speed is really not an issue anymore, so a second goal is to provide readable code that is more easily understood by someone looking to see how emulators can be built.

# Required Libraries
The following external libraries are currently required to build apple2emu.
* [SDL 2.X](https://www.libsdl.org/) - For cross platform graphics, key, gamepad, handling
* [SDL Image 2.X](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) - For loading texture images for fonts
* [pdcurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/) - for Windows only.  Uses ncurses on mac and linux.  Used in Debugger
* [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - currently included in apple2emu repo. Used for ingame menus
* [NativeFileDialog](https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog) - currently included in apple2emu repo.  Used for ingame menus
* [Glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) -- GL Extension wrangler library.  Needed to provide runtime glue for application to host GL function calls.

## Building the emulator
There are two ways to build the editor:  cmake and Visual Studio 2015 (not generated by cmake).  I use VS 2015 for my main development and have kept the VS solution up to date.  I have also added cmake support (which can also generate VS solutions).  So for windows, either method will work, although it's probably easier for windows users to use the provided solution.

### Windows
Open the apple2emu.sln in Visual Studio 2015.  Before the solution can actually be built, some changes will likey need to be made in the proejct settings in order to properly find include file paths and library paths.  To change the paths:

1. Right click on the apple2emu project and select "properties"
2. Select the C/C++ item in the properties tree
3. In the "Additional Include Directories" edit box, choose "edit" from the dropdown
4. Modify the SDL2, SDL2 image, and GLEW paths depending on where you have installed the required libraries
5. Click OK.
6. Select the "Linker" options in the properties tree
7. In the "Additional Library Direcgtories" edit box, choose "edit" from the dropdown
8. Modify the SDL2, SDL2_image, and GLEW paths to where those libraries are installed
9. Click OK on all dialogs to save the settings

At this point, hitting F7 should build the project.

### CMake
To build with Cmake, please do the following:

1. At your machines command line, change to the apple2emu directory
2. type 'mkdir build'
3. type 'cd build'
4. type 'cmake ..'
5. type 'make' (if you generated a makefile.  Note that cmake can build visual studio solutions and if you used cmake to build a visual studio solution, then open the solution with Visual studio and hit F7)

These steps should build the emulator as an executable named 'apple2emu' (or apple2emu.exe on windows). Note that a cmake build will copy provided disk and rom images into the build folder (along with required dlls).  

Cmake will attempt to find the required libraries: SDL2, SDL2_Image, Glew, and ncurses (for non windows machines).  If cmake cannot find any of these required libraries, an error will be produced in which case some hints may need to be given to cmake to find these libraries.

* To help cmake find your SDL2 installation, you can set the environment variable **SDL2** to point to the top level folder where SDL2 is located
* To help cmake find your SDL2_image installation, you can set the environment variable **SDL2_IMAGE** to point to the top level folder where SDL2_image is located
* If GLEW cannot be found you can add the following on the cmake command line:
  * ```cmake .. -DGLEW_INCLUDE_DIR=<path_to_GLEW_include> -DGLEW_LIBRARY=<path_to_glew32s.lib_file>```
  * For example:  ```cmake .. -DGLEW_INCLUDE_DIR=c:\projects\glew-1.13.0\include -DGLEW_LIBRARY=c:\projects\glew-1.13.0\lib\Release\Win32\glew32s.lib```

## Running the emulator
Run the emulator (either type apple2emu from the command line or hit F5 in visual studio).  You will be shown a splash screen and instructions to hit F1 to open the menu.  Hit F1 to bring up the menu where you can set various options.  Specifcally, you will want to choose the emulation type and the disk to load in drive 1 (and possibly drive 2).  

The F1 menu can also be used to control other features of the emulator such as emulator speed and color.  F1 will toggle the menu on and off.

## Integrated 6502 Debugger
There is an integrated 6502 debugger in apple2emu.  Currently, this debugger will run in the console window from which the emulator was started.  I intent to move the debugger to imgui in the future, but for now, it will remain in the console.  In order to support the features I wanted, I require pdcurses (or ncurses) for screen/window maniuplation for the debugger.  Hitting F12 in the emulator will start the debugger.  Currently there is a memory view, register view, breakpoint list, and diassembly.  The debugger currently supports the following commands (curently modelled after gcc:

* 's' or 'step' to single step when broken
* 'c' or 'cont' to continue execution
* 'b' or 'break'  to set read/write breakpoint on memory location
* 'ww' or 'wwatch' to set write watchpoint at a memory location
* 'rw' or 'rwatch' to set read watchpoint at a memory location
* 'enable'/'disable' to enable or disable break or watchpoints
* 'del' to delete break or watch points
* 'x' or 'examine' to view memory content of the specified address
* 'trace' to start a trace dump to file (could create metric ton of output)
* 'q' or 'quit' quits the emulator
