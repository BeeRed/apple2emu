# Apple2Emu - An Apple ][ Emulator

Apple2Emu is an Apple ][ emulator.  Having started programming on the Apple ][ in the early 80's, I have recently wanted to write an emulator for that system.

## Building  
Apple2Emu currently only builds for Visual Studio 2015.  Because this project uses SDL (and other cross platform libraries), support for OSX and Linux should follow soon.  

## License
Apple2Emu is covered under the MIT license.  A copy of this license is available in the same directory as this file under the name License.txt
